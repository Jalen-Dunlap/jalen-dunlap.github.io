# Welcome to the beginning!

This is my first post of what will hopefully be a weekly update on development progression for my different projects. With that said, we are at the very beginning of the development process, and there is not much in terms of development to share. So instead, I will do what I can to give an example of what an actual post will end up looking like, while hopefully not completely embarrasing myself with a lot of poor grammar and spelling mistakes.

## Which project and the development goal for the week

This is where I will give a description of what I attempted to develop for the week. So here I might include some of the development ideas and what programs I am using to do the development. This will probably be a relatively short section in general as the meat of the development will follow.

### Successfully developed item 1

Ideally this section will have something in it each week relating to what I have accomplished towards the week's goal above. I will show examples of what I have succeeded in developing based on the goal for the week and it will be a specific goal.

### Successfully developed item 2 etc.

Here lies the second explanation of a successfully developed goal item for the week. This could be as many as 6 items and as few as 0.

### Goals that are in-progress but were not completed

I think the header above states it all but items that are not fully developed or that happen to get blocked will be described here. Depending on the status of each item it might be split into specific in-progress items like the above Success Items.

### Summary of how I feel development went this week

Once again I think minimal explanation is needed here as summarizing what a summary is seems a little redundant. :D

## Next week's Goals or project of attack

I really would like to refrain from burning out on any one project as that would derail the whole purpose of developing the things that I enjoy. So each week will have a target project for development. I will try to outline what the next project update will entail and the goals I am setting for myself.
