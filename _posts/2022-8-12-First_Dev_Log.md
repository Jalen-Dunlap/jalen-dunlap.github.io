# My first Dev Log!

Welcome back! This is the first week of having something to report on my journey to become a developer in the field of app and games. This week has a focus on trial and error with different game related things in the FPS style of game.

## FPS Development following Unity Tutorials
After doing some research about creating a game for the first time through different video dev logs on YouTube, there was a lot of advice that said DO NOT START WITH YOUR DREAM GAME. Hearing this advice, I decided to do a few smaller projects before jumping in and fully commiting to completing my "Dream Game".

To accomplish this task, I decided this week would be dedicated to completing and finishing tutorials that Unity has developed in an effort to get ideas for my first small game. Once I get an idea for the small game, I want to create a timeline and develpoment schedule. This will help me to learn how big my aspirations for creating a game may or may not be.

### Creator Kit: FPS - Unity Learn
The first tutorial that seemed to interest me was an FPS game kit. Since I enjoy a good FPS game, I figured why not see some of the inner workings of one. This creator kit was a full development kit to create a game around a doctor that was shrunken down and inserted into someone to fight germs. The tutorial was focused around the creation of what would be a single level in the game. This was a nice and easy thing to follow.

#### What did I learn from it?
I learned from this tutorial:
- I will probably need some help or a bit of practice in the art department, if I want to create my own game.
- There will need to be a good premise for the story so players will know what to expect in the game
- If I can properly design aspects of the art and story, a lot of time and effort can be saved
- I will need a lot of art for a full game
- I should take pictures during develpoment so I can share them here, when I do these Dev Logs


### Junior Programmer Pathway
The next course I began is a Unity learning course to gain the necessary skills to become an entry-level Unity developer. I picked this pathway because it seemed to align most with my interests. The course covers a variety of practices and I was luckily able to test out of the initial coding learning since I already have basic coding knowledge.

Here is the link for the homepage of the [Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer?tab=pathway_map) if you would like to read more in depth about the course itself.
