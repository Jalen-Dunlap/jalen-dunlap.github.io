# My first Dev Log!

Welcome back! This is the first week of having something to report on my journey to become a developer in the field of apps and games. This week has a focus on trial and error with different game-related things in the FPS style of game.

## FPS Development following Unity Tutorials
After doing some research about creating a game for the first time through different video dev logs on YouTube, there was a lot of advice that said DO NOT START WITH YOUR DREAM GAME. Hearing this advice, I decided to do a few smaller projects before jumping in and fully committing to completing my "Dream Game".

To accomplish this task, I decided this week would be dedicated to completing and finishing tutorials that Unity has developed, in an effort to get ideas for my first small game. Once I get an idea for the small game, I want to create a timeline and development schedule. This will help me to learn how big my aspirations for creating a game may or may not be.

### Creator Kit: FPS - Unity Learn
The first tutorial that seemed to interest me was an FPS game kit. Since I enjoy a good FPS game, I figured why not see some of the inner workings of one? This creator kit was a full development kit to create a game around a doctor that was shrunken down and inserted into someone to fight germs. The tutorial was focused on the creation of a single level in the game. This was a nice and easy thing to follow.

#### What did I learn from it?
I learned from this tutorial:
- I will probably need some help or a bit of practice in the art department if I want to create my own game.
- There will need to be a good premise for the story so players will know what to expect in the game
- If I can properly design aspects of the art and story, a lot of time and effort can be saved
- I will need a lot of art for a full game
- I should take pictures during development so I can share them here when I do these Dev Logs


### Junior Programmer Pathway
The next course I began is a Unity learning course to gain the necessary skills to become an entry-level Unity developer. I picked this pathway because it seemed to align most with my interests. The course covers a variety of practices and I was luckily able to test out of the initial coding learning since I already have basic coding knowledge.

Here is the link for the homepage of the [Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer?tab=pathway_map) if you would like to read more in-depth about the course itself.

#### What am I learning
In this programmer pathway, I am learning patience and common principles of game design. From what I can tell so far, I have enough coding knowledge to understand what is going on when code is being written and run. Where I fall short is in experience in properly utilizing the game engine's capabilities to do things I want the objects in the game to do by myself.

### Summary
This week I accomplished a few things of note:
- I need to work on getting art done if I want to develop my own game
- Planning things out in bite-sized pieces and finishing them before moving on is a must
- I need more experience before I begin a game that I want to have extra polished and or popular

With these things in mind, I can look forward to the next week of continuing this training and getting better at this game development thing.

## Next Week Goals/Project
This Junior Programmer Pathway seems to be a very long course, so this will probably be the topic of the next few logs that I post. I am fine with that and I hope to keep this log up to date with what I have learned and what I am doing at the moment to get better each step of the way. 

My goal for next week's dev log is to have the first quarter of the course done. With the experience from my past course and the knowledge that I have currently, I think this is a realistic goal. I should be putting in 1-4 hours a day which can quickly add up to enough time to complete what I set up for myself.

I look forward to writing again!
